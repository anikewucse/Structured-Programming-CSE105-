First Project of My University Life

Problem Statement

A magic square is an n x n matrix in which every row, column and diagonal add up to the same number. 
Even wonder how to construct a magic square? 
A silly way to make one is to put the same number is every entry of the matrix. 

In this project, our task is make a magic square program using C language.
